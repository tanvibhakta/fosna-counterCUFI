About <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/12/12/16761540/jerusalem-israel-embassy-palestinians-trump-evangelicals"><span style="text-decoration:underline">one-third</span></a> of evangelical Christians in the United States believe that support for such actions from Israel will help hasten the desired end of the world. While most theologians consider it heresy, many Christians hold this far-right ideology without realizing its implications.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionists make up the largest US voting bloc supporting Israel’s worst practices. Christian Zionist Lobbys like CUFI leverage their political power to ensure the US gives moral and political cover to Israeli <a href="https://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2018/06/08/the-colonization-of-palestine-rethinking-the-term-israeli-occupation/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">colonization</span></a>, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/06/04/israel-50-years-occupation-abuses#"><span style="text-decoration:underline">war crimes</span></a>, and <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/israels-ethnic-cleansing-was-not-historical-exception-palestine-it-happening-today"><span style="text-decoration:underline">ethnic cleansing</span></a>.&nbsp; </p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Understanding the political ideology of Christian Zionism</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is a politically potent force mobilized by organizaions like Christians United for Israel (CUFI) to directly fund Israeli settlements, lobby political leaders, and demonize Palestinian solidarity movements. The ideology gained and maintains power by aligning itself with the goals of empire, providing theological and moral cover for colonialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">History</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The history of Christian Zionism deeply tied to Fundamentalist Christianity, an ideology which historically and currently supports white supremacy and imperialism.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism dates back to the early 1800s, and&nbsp; predates Jewish Zionism. Decades before Theodor Herzl founded the secular Jewish movement of Zionism (1897), British Christian leaders were already fixated with the idea that “Jews should move to Palestine.”&nbsp; Building off of popular theology at the time which viewed Europeans as “Christian Soldiers” transfering God’s battle plans from the “<a href="https://www.massbible.org/exploring-the-bible/ask-a-prof/answers/what-culturally-sensitive-way-refer-old-testament"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Old Testament</span></a>" into the modern era (or “dispensation” in their terms) they believed that Jewish rule in Palestine was part of God’s strategy.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This Christian Zionist theology is deeply tied to empire. It originated at the height of British colonial expansion. The expansion allowed more Europeans to visit the “Christian Holy Land” of Palestine, many of these travelers were influential preachers. Informed by their theology, they falsely portrayed the land as an empty place awaiting Jewish entry.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By the early 20th century, leading politicians in Britain including Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Lord Arthur Balfour, were deeply influenced by Christian Zionism. They and others supported the fledgling Jewish Zionist movement, helping it grow power and influence in Britain. This culminated in The Balfour Declaration, which&nbsp; Zionism international recognition, and is still used as justification for Zionist takeover of Palestine.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When leading American evangelists saw how these ideas influenced audiences, Christian Zionism became a key part of the Christian Fundamentalist movement of the early 1900s. That movement -- and the Evangelical “Religious Right” movement it has spawned has been mobilized<a href="http://huffpost.com/entry/with-trump-the-religious_b_12656872"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">to oppose racial integration, women’s liberation, and LGBTQ rights</span></a>. Political support for Israel remains a major tenet of Christian Fundamentalism. For them the founding of the state of Israel, and its colonization of Jerusalem in 1967 was a fulfilment of prophecy, and therefore proved their racist theology.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Current Political Influence</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A number of organizations promote Christian Zionist goals. They give money to Israeli settlements, perpetuate anti-Muslim hatred, slander those who speak up for Palestinian rights, and have incredible lobbying power with the US government. The largest of these organizations is Christians United for Israel (CUFI). They self report a following of 8 million members, this is more than ten times the size of the much more infamous lobby group AIPAC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Started in 2006, Christians United for Israel (CUFI), has long held strong connections within conservative politics. Its founder John Hagee was described by George W Bush’s Press Secretary as being “able to quickly get someone on the phone at the White House”. As CUFI has grown into a massive and influential political machine in recent years, conservative Christians are able to translate their Christian Zionist beliefs in policy. While CUFI has long held political sway with past administrations, it found its champion in Donald Trump.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Since his election, CUFI has celebrated playing a role in some of Trump’s most hawkish and repressive policies, such as the<a href="https://www.cufi.org/cufi-welcomes-pres-trumps-jerusalem-policy/"><span style="text-decoration:underline"> move of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem</span></a>,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/12/17/how-donald-trump-is-stoking-anti-semitism-while-claiming-fight-it/"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">the "Executive Order on Combating Antisemitism"</span></a>,<a href="https://www.cufi.org/cufi-urges-congress-to-advance-bill-recognizing-israeli-sovereignty-over-golan-heights/"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">annexation of the Golan Heights</span></a>,<a href="https://www.cufi.org/taylor-force-act-ending-us-funding-pa-terror-payments-set-congressional-markup/"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">cutting humanitarian funding to Palestinians</span></a>, and<a href="https://www.cufi.org/reimpositionsanctionsoniran/"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">hostility with Iran</span></a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While many people have criticized organizations like AIPAC for promoting harmful US policies toward Palestinians, AIPAC’s size and influence pales in comparison to CUFI.&nbsp; CUFI has quietly become the largest organization in the United States driving support for Israel’s colonization and military occupation of Palestine, including imprisoning Palestinian children; bombing homes, schools, and hospitals in Gaza; massacring peaceful protestors; and confiscating Palestinian land.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">CUFI has cemented their place as a religious-nationalist organization that openly drives U.S. imperialism and ongoing Israeli take over in Palestine,&nbsp; -- all in the name of Christianity.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Understanding the theological background of Christian Zionism</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At its core, Christian Zionism is a political theology. It is a synthesis of political ideology and religious belief, designed to give Christian Zionists the necessary theological and economic justifications to support their position of supporting Israel, no matter what. Essentially, it is an attempt to give a divine endorsement to the modern state of Israel and to gloss over any act of violence committed by Israel. Most Evangelical Christians hold a Christian Zionst perspective without even realizing it. While it is widely held it is not deeply held (see talking to Christian Zionists).&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">End Times Theology</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This theology is heavily rooted in apocalyptic Christian eschatology, which is about the end of human history and how that end comes to be. Within this framework, the creation of Israel as a state is a fulfilment of Biblical prophecy and marks an important signpost before Jesus returns. The return of Jesus is intimately tied with blissful concepts for many Christians, such as the end of all suffering, the earth being returned to its original perfection, and eternal comfort.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionist theology holds that, before this enticing future can come to be, that Israel must gather all the Jews of the world, enlarge its territory, destroy Muslim holy places, and ethnically cleanse “the holy land” of all non-Jews. About<a href="http://lifewayresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Evangelical-Attitudes-Toward-Israel-Research-Study-Report.pdf"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">two-thirds</span></a> of evangelical Christians in the United States believe that support for such actions from Israel will help hasten the desired end of the world. This particular belief is fairly recent in Christian history, only coming into popular belief in the 1800s through John Darby and William Blackstone. Christian Zionism is a far-right ideology that the majority of Christian denominations do not ascribe to. Yet very popular Evangelists have sold this ideology widely. It’s popularity is due in large part to the second tenent of the ideology.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Economic Theology</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The second part of Christian Zionism is as deeply pragmatic and concerned about life on this earth as the first part is esoteric and concerned about a life to come. Motivated by economic connections to a prosperous Israeli state, Christian Zionism holds fast to Genesis 12:3, where God says to Abram <em>“I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.”</em> In their interpretation, the modern state of Israel is the “you” referred to in that verse. Drawing from principles tied to the prosperity gospel, which is the belief that God will cause people to have financial and material success, this interpretation predicates people’s “blessedness” on their support for the state of Israel.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In response to this economic theology, organizations have risen up to ensure that Christians are continually supporting Israel monetarily, and politically. The largest and most powerful of these organizations is CUFI.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While Christian Zionism has many theological elements, it is an ideology that is built upon greed, and power. The theology acts as a smoke screen for the hateful ideology which lies beneath.&nbsp; &nbsp;﻿</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’s wrong with Christian Zionism</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Understanding the history and theological background of Christian Zionism a few points become painfully clear</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is powerful</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christians United for Israel is the biggest and strongest Israel lobby in the country. They claim to have more than ten as many members as AIPAC. Though CUFI officially reports spendinig less money on lobbying than AIPAC, it’s categorization as a “Church” <a href="https://www.sacurrent.com/the-daily/archives/2019/09/10/apocalypse-now-why-pastor-john-hagee-has-never-been-more-politically-powerful-or-terrifying"><span style="text-decoration:underline">shields it from having to report much of its income and spending</span></a>, allowing CUFI the power to spend without accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is anti-peace&nbsp;</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is important to point out the CUFI’s political goal is not “peace in the Middle East.” Quite the opposite, as their theology and lobbying efforts show, they support Israeli dominance. CUFI has consistently decried any peace negotiation in the region, especially the <a href="https://www.cufi.org/cufi-talking-points-iran-deal/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">peace deal with Iran</span></a>. To them war and hostility are positive signs that they are achieving their goals of bringing about the end of the world.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is Christian supremacist</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism was built upon, and maintains the idea Christianinty exclusively. That Christianity holds the truth, and all other religions (and especially secularists) are inferior. Organizations like CUFI push for <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/02/29/sociologist-andrew-whitehead-how-christian-nationalism-drives-american-politics/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Christian nationalism</span></a>, the privileging of “cultural Christianity,” and “traditional [read white] values” in American civil life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is anti-Muslim</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ideology of Christian Zionism demands an enemy. To evanglicals that enemy is Muslim. Christian Zionist leaders are some of the worst perpetuators of anti-Muslim bigetry in the world. As one researcher put it, “Nearly every evangelical supporter of Israel I spoke with joined his biblical and political views to reach two related conclusions: that God has given the Jews eternal ownership of the entire biblical land of Israel and that Arabs and other Muslims are determined to sabotage that divine covenant.”&nbsp; Within Christian Zionisms conception, Muslims, and Arabs (they rarely differentiate between the two) must play the role of “enemies of God’s will.”&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is antisemitic&nbsp;</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Organizations like CUFI claim to be “philo-semitic” based on a shared political interest with many Jewish organizations in “supporting Israel.” Yet CUFI’s support for Israel’s worst practices is purely self-centered, and not out of any care for Jews.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism construes Jewish identity and values to fit into its neat stereotype. Christian Zionism is not a “post-Holocaust” theology which wrestles with the historic Christian supremacy that led to genocide. Instead it maintains Christian Supremisy, using Israel as proof of Christianities exclusive truth claims.&nbsp; The ideology does not care about Jewish values, diasporic Jews, or Judaism, only Israel’s value to Christian Zionism.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The words of Christian Zionist leaders further bear this out. John Hagee, head of CUFI<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-wilson/netanyahu-ally-john-hagee_b_6848226.htmlHagee,%20Jerusalem%20Count%20Down,%2057."> <span style="text-decoration:underline">propagates a number of antisemitic stereotypes</span></a>. He has claimed that Hitler was a “half breed Jew,” that God cursed Jews, that “Rothchild bankers in Europe” controlled the economy, that the holocaust was ordained by God to send Jews “back to Israel,” and that antisemitism and the holocaust itself was the fault of Jews. He declared, “Their own rebellion had birthed the seed of anti-Semitism that would arise and bring destruction to them for centuries to come.”</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How to talk about Christian Zionism</h3><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For such an openly hateful, and outdated ideology, Christian Zionism has been allowed to spread unchallenged. This is in part because people have found it easier to ignore rather than confront.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Don’t just talk about what’s wrong with Christian Zionism.<br>Do clearly articulate the alternative of Liberation Theology.&nbsp;</h4><p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It should be clear that Christian Zionism is a problematic ideology. But it’s not enough just to tear down Christian Zionism. We also offer an alternative theology that is centered on the liberatory message of Jesus.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A common Christian Zionist talking point is to portray any other Christian Theology as “replacement theology,” an antisemitic theology that teaches that Christianity replaced Judaism as the “Chosen People. If we do not state what we believe in we open ourselves to this critique.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Liberation Theology says that all people are loved by God, all lands are holy, and God is not a racist real estate agent, but God is on the side of the poor and oppressed. Being clear on what we are about preempts the false dichotomy between Christain Zionism and replacement theology.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We know, in fact that, Christian Zionism doesn’t solve any of the problems of Christian antisemitism. It doesn’t problematize Christian supremacy, it doesn’t reinterpret antisemitic scriptures, doesn’t do any of the hard work of “post-Holocaust theology,” nor does it seek to deeply understand Judaism or Jewish values. Instead it shortcuts all of that, implying that supporting Israel is the only needed correction for Christianity in the face of its role in Holocaust. Christian Zionism construes Jewish identity and values to fit into its neat stereotype. Christian Zionists do not care about Jewish values, diaspora Jews, or Judaism, only Israel’s value to Christian Zionism.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Liberation Theology calls for the liberation of all people from forces of oppression. It critiques Colonial Christianity that claims superiority over other religions and people. We confront the antisemitism perpetuated by European Christians as we recognize its connection to anti-Muslim and even anti-Catholic beliefs. Liberation theology demands that we have an intersectional analysis, not pitting the oppression of one group against another, but recognizing the systems that cause oppression. </p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Don’t get caught up in Theological debates. <br>Do Talk about Real life consequences of the belief.</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you hear Christian Zionist pastors speak about Israel they will pay lip service to scripture, usually prooftexting one or two verses, but they will quickly shift the focus to political realities. While Christian Zionism is portrayed as spiritual and not political, the&nbsp; beliefs have terrible political ramifications for the real lives of real people, all over the world. Focus on the real life effects of the belief rather than debating the abstract theological nuances when talking about Christian Zionism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When discussing Christian Zionism, we must recognize that Christian Zionism runs directly in line with views of<a href="http://contendingmodernities.nd.edu/global-currents/christian-zionism-american-modernity-trump-declaration-jerusalem/#_ftnref1"> <span style="text-decoration:underline">American exceptionalism and whiteness/racism</span></a>. That is why it wields such power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The key take away is that the lens which Evangelicals view Israel through, though a primarily spiritual one, ties them to a political ideology. It is part of their Christian mythology, connected deeply to American mythology. Their key concern with Israel is seeing their ideology propagated by their mythology manifesting (as it is destiny) as soon as possible. While they invest in specific Israeli policies (and US policies toward Israel) that they view as proving their end time theory, they have little knowledge of the human and environmental costs of such policies.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Exposing the contradiction of Evangelicals who truly believe their theology is just, and believe that supporting Israel is part of their theology by showing that Christian Zionist theology perpetuates injustice is a key way to talk about Christian Zionism.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So when talking about Christain Zionism talk about Palestinian home demolitions. Talk about the aparthied system Israel has created. Talk about children being locked away. Talk about increased violence and hostility. These are all manifestations of Christian Zionism affecting US policy that wants Israel to expand its territory, remove all non-Jews from the land, and protect Israel from any scrutiny claiming that God will curse those who go against the government of Israel!</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Don’t take it for granted as a Christian doctrine.<br>Do contextualize it historically and politically.</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is a <a href="https://www.anglicanjournal.com/christian-zionism-a-heresy-says-anglican-priest/"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Christian heresy</span></a> because it teaches ethnic exclusivity which goes directly against the life and teachings of Jesus. Yet it is often placed as the default Christian understanding, which we must debunk. Placing Christian Zionism in its proper <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hFk-V4BDaAOeHksuC9bZhUUerCp9pztn78_3fvrWcP8/edit#heading=h.jlzv4a818t5x"><span style="text-decoration:underline">historical context, reveals it as the theology of empire</span></a>. It is based on a theology that is both relatively modern in Christain history, and is already outdated; Part of a long line of Imperial Christianity Including the doctrine of discovery, manifest destiny, slaveholder religion. There is also a long and distinguished line of Christian movements which spoke against such abusive religion. Liberation Theology is among them.&nbsp;</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Don’t write it off as a fringe religious ideology<br>Do recognize the ways its real life influence on US Politics and your community</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Christian Zionism is not constrained to the confines of CUFI summits. Diluted forms of these ideas are widespread. They are prevalent in every Christian denomination, and have an effect far beyond Christianity as well.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beyond right wing idealogues like John Hagee, the Christian establishment is solidly Zionist, or at least find it more convinient to stay silent then to stand up for rights and dignity of Palestinians who are fighting a liberation struggle against genocide. Christiians have a unique responsibility to speak out against Christian Zionism, and to support the Palestinian freedom struggle.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The fight against CUFI and other Christian Zionists is not only an internal Christian battle. CUFI’s influence affects all of us. Their ideology is built upon the idea that white European Christians are superior, and it influences US policy. We are all affected, and we all have a stake in challenging it. </p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">More Resources for Understanding Christian Zionism</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">FOSNA webinar</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">FOSNA PowerPoint</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sunday School curriculums</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With God on Our Side film </p></li></ul><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Confronting Christian Zionism</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is not enough for us to merely understand that Christian Zionism is wrong. We must be willing to confront the people and power structures which perpetuate this hateful ideology.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Conversations: Talking to Christian Zionists on a personal level.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Most of us probably know someone who holds Christian Zionist ideas. Usually they are part of Evangelical Churches that preach conservative ideology as gospel.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is important to recognize that Christian Zionism is a part of any given Evangelical Christian’s broader identity.&nbsp; For some this part central, but for most to be a Christian Zionist is just a marginal part of what they’ve been taught to believe, and it’s never been strongly challenged. Understanding this, it is easier to see how genuinely “nice” people, interpersonally, can hold ideologies that are so hateful and racist.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While FOSNA’s strategy is to intervene on a national level by challenging Christian Zionist organizations like CUFI, we also understand the power of individual transformation. Many of our supporters formerly held Christian Zionist ideologies. Confronting someone you have a relationship with about a hateful ideology which they likely don’t realize they hold takes courage. We recognize and honor that. We want to offer some tips we have learned from doing this work on the interpersonal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tips</h3><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Keep it simple</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">People love to say how complicated the situation is as a way to not deal with it. But it’s very simple: Palestinians want what all people want: the freedom to take care of their families, pursue their dreams, and feel safe and secure in their homes and communities. It’s that simple.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tell stories (your story)</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stories are much more memorable than statistics. People can’t argue with your personal experiences.</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lead with shared values</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As Christians, Evangelicals claim that they believe God loves everyone equally. That freedom, truth, and Justice are righteous pursuits. That “the Church” is called to feed the hungry and lift up the downtrodden. Start by affirming these beliefs, recognizing that they hold them genuinely. Then explain how their Christian Zionist beliefs are counter to their more important “Christian calling.”&nbsp; Again use your own experience of how CZ affects Palestinians in “ways that aren’t Christian.”</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Describe what you seek not what you oppose</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can easily get caught in a reaction trap, responding to what we are against, instead of naming what we support. One important part is to not repeat opposition talking points, this is especially important when there is an audience. If someone calls Palestinians “Terrorists” don’t waste your breath saying, “They aren’t terrorists.” Instead say “Palestinians are using nonviolence to fight for their freedom.”</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Name Palestinians </h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another important way to avoid the reaction trap is to center Palestinians. Rather than arguing about what Israel should and shouldn’t do without much acknowledgement of its impacts to Palestinians, center what Palestinians have to deal with.</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Teach-Ins: Educating your communities about Christitan Zionism</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Host a public educational event on Christian Zionism. Or teach a Sunday School class about Christian Zionism. We have Teach-In Toolkits for Christian and non-Christian audiences.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3AAYV5CW117UIts_h8eeQ_ExhUSnvKA4MQNMlDpffE/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Teach-in Tool on Christian Zionism for General Audiences</span></a></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i4Y4qFvf0ohZ1jhL726Kj-Xh5fyWZrQQuFGIleURLSU/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Teach-in Tool on Christian Zionism for Christian Audiences</span></a>&nbsp;</p><h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nonviolent Direct Action: Speaking out against the toxic ideology of Christian Zionism.</h3><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nonviolent direct action offers the strategies to win. It allows a small passionate group of people to have an oversized voice. Whether this is your first time thinking of using nonviolent direct action or you’re a seasoned pro, here are some things to know!</p><h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Nonviolent Skill Building</h4><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/affinitygroups"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Affinity Groups</span></a> First thing, get in touch with aligned organizers in your city.
